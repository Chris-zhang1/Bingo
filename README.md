This source code includes the implementation of our proposal, named **Bingo**, as well as the implementation of competing methods such as **BOP**, **SPP**, **VLDP**, **AMPM**, and **SMS**. Everything is implemented on top of a modified version of the [ChampSim](https://github.com/ChampSim/ChampSim) simulator. Several scripts for running simulations and gathering results are also provided in this repo. Enjoy! :)
